### :bug: Creating Issues
If you found a bug, search if an issue already exists search if an issue already exists. If it doesn't, you can create a new issue with the bug label. Likewise, if you would like to suggest an enhancement, first see if a similar issue was already created. Then, create a new issue with the enhancement label.

### :white_check_mark: Solving Issues
Create a new branch with the form: <username>/<branch-function>. After changing the repo locally and pushing to your branch's remote origin, create a pull request with a short description of your changes.
